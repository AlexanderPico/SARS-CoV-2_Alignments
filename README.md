# SARS-CoV-2_Alignments
Sequence alignments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and previously studied proteins

GitHub Pages: https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/

## Purpose
While curating pathway models for the various functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, I often stumbled upon previously [published pathway figures](https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-covidpathways/) and [solved protein structures](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=A4D8F222) relating to the prior rounds of coronavirus research. The obvious questions in these cases are "how similar are the sequences" and "are the critical residues conserved?" 

In the open science spirit of the times, I'm sharing these protein sequence alignments along with my observations on particularly interesting similarities and, by extension, functional predictions. 

## Content
* `index.html` provides a consolidated web view of all alignments in this repo
* `.fa files` are separate multiple sequence alignment files in fasta format
* `.jvp file` is a [Jalview](https://www.jalview.org/) project file containing all alignments
